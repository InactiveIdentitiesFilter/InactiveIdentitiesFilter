Admin Tool Inactive Identities Filter
Overview
This Moodle plugin is designed to remove inactive identities. For now, two criteria are used for removal. 

Criteria are the time of inactivity and affiliation to the course. 

Users can be notified by using a generic message sent to them via email before deletion. Notification mail for all users van be set up from the 
Site administration > Users > Permissions.

If the admin chooses to search for users by the period of inactivity, he must first select the specified option in the menu.
After that, the admin must select a period of inactivity and query system for inactive users.
The selected users can then be notified by e-mail or immediately deleted.

Users can also be selected according to the course they are attending. Again, the selected users can then be notified by e-mail or immediately deleted.


To install, place all files in /admin/tool/inactiveidentities and visit /admin/index.php in your browser.
